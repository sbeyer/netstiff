Description: powerful tool to check for web page updates
 netstiff (formerly known as webdiff) is a powerful and easy-to-use web
 page update checker. Updates are recognized using several test criteria
 (diff, html, size, date, md5sum, regexp).
 .
 Without any given arguments, netstiff will only print the URIs of web 
 pages that changed - one per line - so that the output of netstiff can 
 easily be used by further scripts (e.g. wget or mail).
 In `diff' and `html' mode a diff-like output can be generated from the
 changes. It also comes with a built-in interactive configuration tool.
