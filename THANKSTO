I have to thank the following people for contributing to webdiff:
 - Lars Christensen (for writing libalgorithm-diff for Ruby)
 - Alexander Logvinov (for a lot of testing, bugfinding and feature ideas)
 - Dr. Jens Schleusener (pointed to problems using outdated libalgorithm-diff)
 - Eduard Bloch (pointed me to name conflicts with websec's webdiff)
 - Roland Krystian Alberciak (some discussion)
 - Martin Aumueller (made me using webdiff again).
